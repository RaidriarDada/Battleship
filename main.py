    How it will work:
    1. A 10x10 grid will have 8 ships of variable length randomly placed about
    2. You will have 50 bullets to take down the ships that are placed down
    3. You can choose a row and column such as A3 to indicate where to shoot
    4. For every shot that hits or misses it will show up in the grid
    5. A ship cannot be placed diagonally, so if a shot hits the rest of
        the ship is in one of 4 directions, left, right, up, and down
    6. If all ships are unearthed before using up all bullets, you win
        else, you lose
    Legend:
    1. "." = water or empty space
    2. "O" = part of ship
    3. "X" = part of ship that was hit with bullet
    4. "#" = water that was shot with bullet, a miss because it hit no ship
